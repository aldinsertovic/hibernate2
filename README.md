# hibernate2
The hibernate1 application in my repository has now been modified to use the Hibernate Persistence Framework.
It is possible to record, read changes, and delete employee data.
The application has the following functionalities:
display of all employees from the base,
modification of employee data based on ID,
deleting an employee based on an ID
bringing in a new employee to the base.
